# JavaFX-Flappy-Bird

a very meagre toy example for flappy bird.

The only different is I want to use a complete timeline based implementation for all the animations (most of the existing works are using the manipulation of positions to control the game).

The components used are Timeline and AnimationTimer.

The project is created with Eclipse (Version: Mars.2 Release (4.5.2), Build id: 20160218-0600) and JDK (1.8.0_201).

images in Asset comes from repo:https://github.com/Code-Bullet/Flappy-Bird-AI and https://github.com/john525/Flappy-Bird-Clone.
